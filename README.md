# Player UP!

## Description

Player UP is a social application designed to organize people with a similar interest - in this case games of all kinds!  A user can signup for a user account. When logged in they can browse local activities that are available to sign up to participate in, sign up for activities, and add an event for others to join. 

This is a MERN stack application composed of a REACT front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API with a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server.
